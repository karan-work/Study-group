## How to run this program
#### To run this program, use your terminal and type `node hello.js`, passing in either nothing, a first name or a first and last name. 

#### Clone this repo and run `npm install` at the topmost file level to install dependencies. 
#### Use the terminal command `npx cypress open` in your terminal to open up the Cypress test runner and execute against a browser instance.
#### Configure your directory for E2E tests and click on the file containing your test. It should open up a Chrome instance (if you choose Chrome instead of Electron) and run your test. When returning to the test runner, you'll see all of your Cypress tests in the file directory.
